# ft_ls
Its behavior must be identical to the original ls command with the following vari-
ations:
◦ Amongst the numerous options available, we are asking you to create the
following: -l, -R, -a, -r and -t.
◦ We strongly recommend that you account for the implications of the
option -R from the very beginning of your code...
◦ You do not have to deal with the multiple column format for the exit when
the option -l isn’t in the arguments.
◦ You are not required to deal with ACL and extended attributes.
◦ The overall display, depending on each option, must stay as identical as pos-
sible to the system command. We will be cordial when grading either the
padding or the pagination, but no information can be missing.
